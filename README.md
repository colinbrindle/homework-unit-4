# Unit 4 Web APIs: Quiz Game

### **Project Description**
The aim of this project was to create a JavaScript quiz game by utilizing web APIs. This project was challenging overall as it required a lot of trial and error before my various functions would execute correctly. While it was a challenge, this project instilled in me JavaScript best practices such as using the console.log() method as a debugging tool.

The quiz game is unfinished at it's current state as the local storage leaderboard is not yet complete.
